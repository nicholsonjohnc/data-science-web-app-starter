# Data Science Web App Starter
Starter project for building data science web apps.

## Step 1 - Sign up / sign in to AWS

[here](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Step 2 - Register a domain name using Route 53

[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html)

NOTE: You can purchase a domain name elsewhere, but I generally prefer to do as much as possible in AWS.
Their prices are competitive and consistent. Performance is unmatched. No gotchas. 
Also, development is easier having everything in one place.
